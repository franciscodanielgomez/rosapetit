*I am a dedicated, professional, and quality of work person, my personal qualities let me be immediately integrated with every group.*


##  I'm a Medical Physicist

I finished the Master’s program in Advanced Studies in Medical Physics at the University of Trieste in collaboration with ICTP. I also completed my clinical training in radiotherapy at the University Hospital of Siena.

My previous studies were carried out at the Faculty of Science and Technology (Facyt) at the University of Carabobo, where I obtained a degree in Physics (thesis: **Statistical Process Control in Tomotherapy Pre-treatment QA: Fixing Tolerance and Action Limits for the Verification Metrics**).

Subsequently, I served as a professor in the Physics Department at the University of Carabobo, teaching General Physics and Optics (thesis: **Study of the Absorbed Dose Curves in a Tissue Using Monte Carlo Simulation Techniques**).

## Experience

- ### Medical Physics Intern
  #### Jan. 2020 - Jan. 2021 - University Hospital of Siena (Siena, Italy)

  As a medical physicist intern at the University Hospital of Siena, my responsibilities encompassed the safety, performance quality assurance, and control of radiotherapy equipment and imaging devices. This role included subareas such as radiotherapy, diagnostic imaging, and nuclear medicine. My training primarily focused on radiotherapy practices within clinical settings, including EBRT reference dosimetry, EBRT relative dosimetry, imaging equipment management, and radiation protection.


- ### Medical Physics Intern
  #### Jan. 2019 - Dic. 2019 - Trieste Hospital (Trieste, Italy)

  As part of the master’s program, programmed practices were carried out with the purpose of training in the areas of: radiotherapy, imaging diagnosis and nuclear medicine.


- ### Part-time Professor
  #### Jan. 2018 - Dic. 2018 - University of Carabobo (Carabobo, Venezuela)

  Responsible for planning, preparing courses, teaching, organizing, conducting seminars, evaluating students’ progress, preparing and correcting exercises, courses, and exams.


- ### Quality Control Intern
  #### Aug. 2016 - Dic. 2016 - Coteserca Servicios C.A (Carabobo, Venezuela)

  Documentation and organization tasks to support the e ciency and e ectiveness of the calibration process chain. Some duties and responsibilities include were: inspecting output samples using appropriate methods, such as comparing to standards, measuring dimensions and examining functionality, recording inspection results by completing reports and summarizing re-works, and proposing improvements to the production process.


- ### Medical Physics Intern
  #### Aug. 2016 - Dic. 2016 - Oncological Hospital Dr. Miguel Pérez Carreño (Carabobo, Venezuela)

  Observer of the techniques used in oncology for the radiation treatment in several patients, the responsibilities and functions of a doctor, medical physics, and technician. Analysis and documentation of the performance and planning of the treatment carried out for the medical physicist based in Linac and cobalt machine.

- ### Medical Physics Intern
  #### Aug. 2016 - Dic. 2016 - Venezuelan Institute of Scientifc Research (San Antonio, Venezuela)

  Training development in the Nuclear Technology Unit, specifically in the Secondary Laboratory of Calibration Dosimetry (LSCD). The academic training was based on understanding and studying the basic concepts of dosimetric quantities, radiological protection quantities, and dosimetric calibration. I participated in the follow-up of measurement and quality control procedures at the LSCD, and I was involved in the analysis and execution of experimental setups for the calibration of ionizing chambers, Geiger-Muller counters, proportional counters, and numerical detectors.
